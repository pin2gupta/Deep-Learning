        "Keras is a model-level library, providing high-level building blocks for developing deep-learning models. It doesnâ€™t handle low-level operations such as tensor manipulation and differentiation. Instead, it relies on a specialized, well-optimized tensor library to do so, serving as the backend engine of Keras. Rather than choosing a single tensor library and tying the implementation of Keras to that library, Keras handles th problem in a modular way ; thus several different backend engines can be plugged seamlessly into Keras. Currently, the three existing backend implementations are the TensorFlow backend, the Theano backend, and the Microsoft Cognitive\n"
